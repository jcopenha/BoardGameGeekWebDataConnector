> **Important**: Version 2.0 of the WDC is in beta and is incompatible with the currently released versions of Tableau. To try the new WDC in Tableau as soon as possible, sign up for the [beta program](http://www.tableau.com/getbeta) to get early access to Tableau 10.0.
 
To use a WDC in Tableau Desktop, complete the following steps:

1. On the start page, in the **Connect** pane, click **More Servers... > Web Data Connector**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/wdc_desktop_select_wdc_as_connector.png){:width="600px"}

1. Enter the URL of a WDC and press Enter.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/wdc_desktop_enter_url.png){:width="600px"}

   **Important**: Make sure that you enter the URL of a WDC, and not the URL of the data that you're trying to connect to. For example, if you want to connect to Facebook data, you might enter `www.example.com/myFacebookWDC.html`.

1. Tableau loads the WDC page where you can enter any input required by your WDC.

1. Tableau calls your WDC code, downloads data, and displays it in the **Data Source** pane.
